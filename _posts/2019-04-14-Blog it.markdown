"BLOG IT" - Anonymous IRC user

Welcome back long time readers. Hi mom! Who am I kidding, even my mom didn't read my old blog. I can't blame her. All I did was start a Wordpress, secure a sexy domain name, never post after that, and let it rot and wither away -- along with any chance of sharing my thoughts and insights with the world via well written prose. Oh well, their loss? Right???

I used to hate writing. Wait, I still do. As a perfectionist, I'm never happy with anything that I produce. I am overly critical of every perceived mistake, set high (near-unreachable) standards, and am uncomfortable with the tension between my vision and reality. Why bother trying? 

Even though as a child I was interested in all kinds of creative outlet such as painting, drawing, animating cartoons, and playing music, I never pursued those activities either as a professional or an amateur. 

But, I love the idea of being a good writer.
