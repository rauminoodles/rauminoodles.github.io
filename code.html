  <h1>Code</h1>

    <p>Here is some of the code that I have developed for research. Not uploaded to the internet yet but stay tuned!</p>
  
  <h2>Lanczos</h2>
  
    <p>
    C++ code to diagonalize Hermitian matrices using the (Banded) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm">Lanczos algorithm</a> 
    without re-orthogonalization.
    
    </br></br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Features:
    <ul>
      <li>
      Lightweight template header-only library built on top of <a http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_PageEigen>Eigen</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
      User-defined matrix-vector multiplication.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  
  <h2>Noodle</h2>
    <p> (Noo)bie (D)iagonalization: (L)anczos and (E)xact. A simple and easy to implement header-only framework for constructing quantum
    many-body Hamiltonians. Diagonalizes the Hamiltonian matrix either exactly with Eigen or approximately with Lanczos.
    
    </br></br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Features:
    <ul>
      <li>
      Lightweight template header-only library built on top of <a http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_PageEigen>Eigen</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
      Can treat both fermions and bosons.
      </li>
      <li>
      Compute: excitation spectrums and static & dynamic correlation functions (e.g. specific heat, Green's functions, dynamic structure factor, etc.).
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    </br></br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp So far has treated:
    <ul>
      <li>
      Excitation spectrums and thermodynamic static correlation functions of spinless fermions and bosons on a sphere with a magnetic monopole at the center
      to study fractional quantum Hall physics.
      </li>
      <li>
      Green's function and spin susceptibilities for: 1D & 2D Fermi-Hubbard model, 2D two-band Fermi-Hubbard model inter-orbital interactions, and 2D pi-flux Fermi-Hubbard model.
      </li>
    </ul>
