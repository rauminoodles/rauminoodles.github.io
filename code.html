  <h1>Code</h1>

    <p>Here is some of the code that I have developed for research. Not uploaded to the internet yet but stay tuned!</p>
  
  <h2>Lanczos [<a>coming soon</a>]</h2>
  
    <p>
    C++ code to diagonalize Hermitian matrices using the <a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781468491807">Lanczos algorithm
    without re-orthogonalization</a>.

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lightweight template header-only library built on top of <a href = "http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_PageEigen">Eigen</a>.</li>
      <li>User-defined matrix-vector multiplication.</li>
      <li>Supports banded Lanczos.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  
  <h2>Noodle [<a>coming soon</a>]</h2>
  (Noo)bie (D)iagonalization: (L)anczos and (E)xact </br></br>
    <p>
    A simple and easy to implement C++ header-only framework for constructing quantum
    many-body Hamiltonians. Diagonalizes the Hamiltonian matrix either exactly with <a href = "http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_PageEigen">Eigen</a> or approximately with Lanczos.
    
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lightweight template header-only library built on top of <a href ="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_PageEigen">Eigen</a>.</li>
      <li>Can treat both fermions and bosons.</li>
      <li>Compute: excitation spectrums and static & dynamic correlation functions (e.g. specific heat, Green's functions, dynamic structure factor, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    
    Because Noodle is a general framework it can treat a wide range of quantum-many-body problems.
    
    <h3>So far Noodle has been used for</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fractional quantum Hall effect
      <ul>
        <li>Model: Spinless fermions and bosons on a sphere with a magnetic monopole at the center and long range Coulomb interactions.</li>
        <li>Calculation: Excitation spectrums and thermodynamic observables e.g. specific heat, entropy, free-energy.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Fermi-Hubbard models
      <ul>
        <li>Models: 1D, 2D, square lattice, kagome lattice, two-orbital, and checkerboard lattice with complex hoppings.</li>
        <li>Calculation: Green's function and spin susceptibility.</li>
      </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
